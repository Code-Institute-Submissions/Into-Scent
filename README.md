# Into Scent 

This project is created to run the fictional workshops for those who would like to gain the knowledge of essential oils and recognise the importance of their well-being physically and mentally 
and also designed to demonstrate my abilities with HTML and CSS using Bootstrap for my first milestone project for Code Institute. 

## UX

This site is designed to provide the basic knowledge and safe usage of natural plant extracts / essential oils for those who are new to aromatherapy 
or would like to improve the health of body and mind, offering different types of workshops. The user is able to see what workshops are currently organised and  to book workshops online. 
It is also possible to make an enquiry or request by filling a form.

### User Stories

- As a parent, I am looking into some ways to bond with my baby. Meantime I would like to learn about essential oils and the benefits of massage. 
- As a new to aromatherapy, I would like to learn the basics about essential oils and to be able to use them at home.
- As a (potential/curious user), I am looking for alternatives to improve my physical and mental health in the most natural way possible.
