# Into Scent 

This project is created to run the fictional workshops for those who would like to gain the knowledge of essential oils and recognise the importance of their well-being physically and mentally 
and also designed to demonstrate my abilities with HTML and CSS using Bootstrap for my first milestone project for Code Institute. 

## UX

This site is designed to provide the basic knowledge and safe usage of natural plant extracts / essential oils for those who are new to aromatherapy 
or would like to improve the health of body and mind, offering different types of workshops. The user is able to see what workshops are currently organised and  to book a workshops online. 
It is also possible to make an enquiry or request by filling a form.

### User Stories

- As a parent, I am looking into some ways to bond with my baby. Meantime I would like to learn about essential oils and the benefits of massage. 
- As a new to aromatherapy, I would like to learn the basics about essential oils and to be able to use them at home.
- As a (potential/curious user), I am looking for some kind of alternatives to improve my physical and mental health in the most natural way possible.

### The site owner's aim

- To increase awareness of workshops / chance of expanding the business in the future 
- To collect the user's current needs
- To provide safe guidance of the usage of essential oils  (pros & cons)
- To acknowledge people the importance of their well-being physically and mentally

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
